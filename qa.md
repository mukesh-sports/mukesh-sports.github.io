types of testing : 
 - Regression Testing	: Ensures that existing features/functionality that used to work are not broken due to new code changes.
 - Smoke Testing	A quick test performed to ensure that the software works at the most basic level and doesn’t crash when it’s started. Its name originates from the hardware testing where you just plug the device and see if smoke comes out.
 - Stress Testing	Ensures that the performance of the software doesn’t degrade when the load increases. In stress testing, the tester subjects the software under heavy loads, such as a high number of requests or stringent memory conditions to verify if it works well.

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) is a fundamental part of SDLC which is used to test software and ensure that the quality standards are met. It generally involves both verification activities and validation activities. In this, different activities are executed in a specific order throughout the software testing process. 

- Requirement Analysis 
- Test Planning 
- Test Case Development 
- Test Environment Setup 
- Test Execution 
- Test Cycle Closure

bug, defect, and error.
Error: It is defined as a programming mistake in coding because of which we can't compile or run a program.  

Defect: It is defined as the variation or difference between the actual result and the expected result founded by a tester or developer. The defect is basically detected after the product goes into production and is resolved in the development phase only.  

Bug: It is defined as a fault or mismatch in a software system that is detected during the testing phase. It has an impact on software functionality and performance.
